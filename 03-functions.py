For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:\ndef do_twice(f):\nf()\nf()\n\nHereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.\ndef print_spam():\nprint('spam')\ndo_twice(print_spam)\n\n1. Type this example into a script and test it.\n2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.\n3. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.\n4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.\n5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.")
